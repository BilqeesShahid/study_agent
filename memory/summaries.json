        "summary": "Gemini CLI is an AI-powered terminal assistant from Google that interacts with your local environment and the web, performing actions beyond simple text generation. It has built-in tools to interact with the local system (read/write files, list folders) and the external web (Google searches, fetch URLs). These tools require permission to run sensitive actions, which can be granted via `--yolomode` (risky) or `--approval-mode` (requires approval). Some key built-in tools include ReadFolder, GoogleSearch + WriteFile, WebFetch, and File Conversion. Other tools enable functions like editing files, finding files, reading multiple files, saving information to memory, searching within files, and running shell commands.\n",
